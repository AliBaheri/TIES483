# Nonlinear Optimization course
University of Jyv채skyl채
Lecturer Markus Hartikainen, PhD

**These are the materials from Nonlinear Optimization course taught at the University of Jyv채skyl채, Finland Jan-March 2015.**

## Course plan

**Introduction**
    1. First hour: Basic information about the course and study methods (Python, Jupyter etc.); second hour: A very fast introduction to Python and Jupyter using https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures.
    2. The very basics: what is an optimization problem, how to solve one, and line search
**Unconstrained optimization**
    3. Direct search methods: Coordinate descent, Hooke&Jeeves, and Powell's methods 
    4. Steepest Descent and Newton's method for unrestricted optimization
    5. Example of using available software: scipy.optimize
**Constrained optimization**
    6. Optimality conditions
    7. Indirect methods for constrained optimization
    8. Direct methods for constrained optimization (part 1)
    9. Direct methods for constrained optimization (part 2)
**Multiobjective optimization**
    10. What is multiobjective optimization
    11. How to solve multiobjective optimization problems
**Applications of optimization**
    12. Applications of optimization (part 1)
    13. Applications of optimization (part 2)
**Optimization software**
    14. Optimization modelling languages, especially Pyomo
    15. IND-NIMBUS(R)
**Wrapping up**
    16. How to find and read scientific papers in the field
    17. Further topics and current research in optimization
    18. Review


# Study methods
## Python and Jupyter
This course is taught using Jupyter notebooks (http://ipython.org/notebook.html, formerly known as IPython notebooks).
## Github
The source code of the Jupyter notebooks thought in this course will be available at Github at https://github.com/maeehart/TIES483.
## Livereveal
The Jupyter notebooks will be transferred to slides using https://github.com/damianavila/RISE. To view the slides at home, you do not need to have this installed.
